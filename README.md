## Problems
- By the way,no matter what project, the configuration environment is the first difficulty,so it cost me some time to  overcome it. 

> So I watch the video of Shangguigu,simply learn the use of react and some relevant.

- The thing that annoys me most is when I was about to finish the project,the pages showed blank,and I didn't think there's a big problem with my project.
  - Finally,i found that it was because  my react version was too low.
- And it was the first time I used git, I was unskilled so that I need to learn more.
- Although I learned react, I can't master ES6 grammar well, so I need to watch it again from time to time.
- Because there are other experiments to learn, I don't have much time to learn more about reasonï¼Œit was my question.
- There is also a problem with the react-beautiful-dnd component library, which always reports an error.
  - Solution: It is still a problem of inconsistent versions,so I try to change the version,then it works.
- There is also the problem of creating a public network. At the beginning, it is always different from the official tutorial. 
  - The solution: once Alibaba Cloud has bought an account, configure it step by step, and then refresh it at the last step, no error will be reported.
  - In fact, I will encounter many problems when I finish each step, but I haven't written them down, because maybe my habit is to try to solve problems first, and then I will develop better habits.
